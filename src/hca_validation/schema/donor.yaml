    title: Donor ID
    description: This must be free-text that identifies a unique individual that data were derived from.
    notes: >
      It is strongly recommended that this identifier be designed so that it is unique to: a given individual within the collection of datasets that includes this dataset, and a given individual across all collections in CELLxGENE Discover. It is strongly recommended that "pooled" be used for observations from a sample of multiple individuals that were not confidently assigned to a single individual through demultiplexing. It is strongly recommended that "unknown" ONLY be used for observations in a dataset when it is not known which observations are from the same individual.

    title: Manner of Death
    description: |
      Manner of death classification based on the Hardy Scale or "unknown" or "not applicable":
      * Category 1 = Violent and fast death — deaths due to accident, blunt force trauma or suicide, terminal phase < 10 min.
      * Category 2 = Fast death of natural causes — sudden unexpected deaths of reasonably healthy people, terminal phase < 1 h.
      * Category 3 = Intermediate death — terminal phase 1–24 h, patients ill but death unexpected.
      * Category 4 = Slow death — terminal phase > 1 day (e.g. cancer, chronic pulmonary disease).
      * Category 0 = Ventilator case — on a ventilator immediately before death.
      * Unknown = The cause of death is unknown.
      * Not applicable = Subject is alive.
