slots:
  ambient_count_correction:
    title: Ambient Count Correction
    description: Method used to correct ambient RNA contamination in single-cell data.
    range: string
    required: true
    examples:
      - value: "none"
      - value: "soupx"
      - value: "cellbender"
    annotations:
      annDataLocation: uns

  doublet_detection:
    title: Doublet Detection
    description: Was doublet detection software used during CELLxGENE processing? If so, which software?
    range: string
    required: true
    examples:
      - value: "none"
      - value: "doublet_finder"
      - value: "manual"
    annotations:
      annDataLocation: uns

  dataset_id:
    title: Dataset ID
    description: A unique identifier for each dataset in the study. This should be unique to the study.
    range: string
    required: true

  sample_id:
    title: Sample ID
    description: >-
      Identification number of the sample. This is the fundamental unit of sampling the tissue (the specimen taken from the subject), which can be the same as the 'subject_ID', but is often different if multiple samples are taken from the same subject. Note: this is NOT a unit of multiplexing of donor samples, which should be stored in "library".
    examples:
      - value: SC24; SC25; SC28
    annotations:
      annDataLocation: obs
      tier: Tier 1
    range: string
    required: true

  donor_id:
    title: Donor ID
    description: >-
      This must be free-text that identifies a unique individual that data were derived from.
    examples:
      - value: CR_donor_1; MM_donor_1; LR_donor_2
    annotations:
      annDataLocation: obs
      tier: Tier 1
      cxg: donor_id
    range: string
    required: true
    comments: >-
      Fundamental unit of biological variation of the data. It is strongly recommended that this identifier be designed so that it is unique to: a given individual within the collection of datasets that includes this dataset, and a given individual across all collections in CELLxGENE Discover. It is strongly recommended that "pooled" be used for observations from a sample of multiple individuals that were not confidently assigned to a single individual through demultiplexing. It is strongly recommended that "unknown" ONLY be used for observations in a dataset when it is not known which observations are from the same individual.

  radial_tissue_term:
    title: Radial Tissue Term
    description: Radial compartment/location of the tissue sample.
    range: RadialTissueTerm
    required: true

  deprecated_slot:
    title: Deprecated Slot
    description: Placeholder string slot that can be extended (via is_a) for deprecated or transitional metadata fields.
    range: string
    required: false
    multivalued: false
