  author_batch_notes:
    title: Author Batch Notes
    description: >-
      Encoding of author knowledge on any further information related to likely batch effects.
    examples:
      - value: Batch run by different personnel on different days
    annotations:
      annDataLocation: obs
      tier: Tier 1
    range: string
    required: false
    multivalued: false
    comments: >-
      Space for author intuition of batch effects in their dataset

  cell_number_loaded:
    title: Cell Number Loaded
    description: >-
      Estimated number of cells loaded for library construction.
    examples:
      - value: "5000; 4000"
    annotations:
      annDataLocation: obs
      tier: Tier 1
    range: integer
    required: false
    multivalued: false
    comments: >-
      Can explain the number of doublets found in samples

  cell_viability_percentage:
    title: Cell Viability Percentage
    description: >-
      If measured, per sample cell viability before library preparation (as a percentage).
    examples:
      - value: "88; 95; 93.5"
    annotations:
      annDataLocation: obs
      tier: Tier 1
    range: decimal
    required: false
    multivalued: false
    comments: >-
      Is a measure of sample quality that could be used to explain outlier samples

  institute:
    title: Institute
    description: >-
      Institution where the samples were processed.
    examples:
      - value: EMBL-EBI; Genome Institute of Singapore
    annotations:
      annDataLocation: obs
      tier: Tier 1
    range: string
    required: true
    multivalued: false
    comments: >-
      To be able to link to other studies from the same institution as sometimes samples from different labs in the same institute are processed via similar core facilities. Thus batch effects may be smaller for datasets from the same institute even if other factors differ.

  library_id:
    title: Library ID
    description: >-
      The unique ID that is used to track libraries in the investigator's institution (should align with the publication).
    examples:
      - value: A24; NK_healthy_001
    annotations:
      annDataLocation: obs
      tier: Tier 1
    range: string
    required: true
    multivalued: false
    comments: >-
      A way to track the unit of data generation. This should include sample pooling

  library_id_repository:
    title: Library ID Repository
    description: >-
      The unique ID used to track libraries from one of the following public data repositories: EGAX*, GSM*, SRX*, ERX*, DRX, HRX, CRX.
    examples:
      - value: GSM1684095
    annotations:
      annDataLocation: obs
      tier: Tier 1
    range: string
    required: false
    multivalued: false
    comments: >-
      Links a dataset back to the source from which it was ingested, optional only if this is the same as the library_id.

  library_preparation_batch:
    title: Library Preparation Batch
    description: >-
      Indicating which samples' libraries were prepared in the same chip/plate/etc., e.g. batch1, batch2.
    examples:
      - value: batch01; batch02
    annotations:
      annDataLocation: obs
      tier: Tier 1
    range: string
    required: true
    multivalued: false
    comments: >-
      Sample preparation is a major source of batch effects.

  library_sequencing_run:
    title: Library Sequencing Run
    description: >-
      The identifier (or accession number) that indicates which samples' libraries were sequenced in the same run.
    examples:
      - value: run1; NV0087
    annotations:
      annDataLocation: obs
      tier: Tier 1
    range: string
    required: true
    multivalued: false
