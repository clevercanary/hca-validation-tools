      To understand whether the collection site contributes to batch effects. It is strongly recommended that this identifier be designed so that it is unique to a given site within the collection of datasets that includes this site (for example, the labels 'site1', 'site2' may appear in other datasets thus rendering them indistinguishable).

  sample_collection_relative_time_point:
    title: Sample Collection Relative Time Point

Sample collection dates (e.g. 23/09/22) cannot be used due to patient data protection, only relative time points should be used here (e.g. day3).
