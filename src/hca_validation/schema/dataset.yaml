slots:
  study_pi:
    description: Principal Investigator(s) leading the study where the data is/was used.
    range: string
    multivalued: true
    required: true
    examples:
      - value: '["Teichmann,Sarah,A."]'
        description: "Principal Investigator in Last Name,MiddleInitial, FirstName format"
  batch_condition:
    description: >-
      Name of the covariate that confers the dominant batch effect in the data as judged by the data contributor. 
      The name provided here should be the label by which this covariate is stored in the AnnData object.
    range: string
    multivalued: true
    required: false
    examples:
      - value: '["patient", "seqBatch"]'
        description: "Multiple batch conditions as a JSON array"
    notes:
      - Values must refer to cell metadata keys in obs. Together, these keys define the batches that a normalisation or integration
        algorithm should be aware of. For example if "patient" and "seqBatch" are keys of vectors of cell metadata, either
        ["patient"], ["seqBatch"], or ["patient", "seqBatch"] are valid values.

        This must be an EFO term and either:
        - "EFO:0002772" for assay by molecule or preferably its most accurate child
        - "EFO:0010183" for single cell library construction or preferably its most accurate child
        - An assay based on 10X Genomics products should either be "EFO:0008995" for 10x technology or preferably its most accurate child. 
        - An assay based on SMART (Switching Mechanism at the 5' end of the RNA Template) or SMARTer technology SHOULD either be "EFO:0010184" for Smart-like or preferably its most accurate child.
        Recommended:
        - 10x 3' v2 "EFO:0009899"
        - 10x 3' v3 "EFO:0009922"

      - Affects which cells are filtered per dataset, and which reads (introns and exons or only exons) are counted as part of the reported transcriptome. This can convey batch effects.

      - Useful to look up protocol data that can provide insight on batch effects. As protocols can sometimes apply to a subset of the study, we capture this at a sample level. This information may not always be available.

    description: >
      This text describes and differentiates the dataset from other datasets in the same collection. 
      It is strongly recommended that each dataset title in a collection is unique and does not depend on other metadata 
      such as a different assay to disambiguate it from other datasets in the collection.
    range: string
