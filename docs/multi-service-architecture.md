# Multi-Service Architecture Refactor

## Goals

Restructure the HCA Validation Tools project to support multiple independent services with separate deployment strategies while maintaining a shared core library.

- **Service Independence**: Each service can be built, tested, and deployed independently
- **Dependency Isolation**: Services have separate dependency management (lightweight Lambda vs heavy Fargate)
- **Shared Core Logic**: Common validation logic, schemas, and utilities are reused across services
- **Clean Deployment**: Each service has its own containerization and deployment configuration

## Design Decisions

### **Shared Core Library**

- **Rationale**: Avoid code duplication for common validation logic
- **Dependencies**: Minimal set (LinkML, pydantic, basic utilities)
- **Distribution**: Path dependency for local development, internal package for production
- **Location**: `shared/src/hca_validation/` maintains existing import structure

### **Service-Specific Dependencies**

- **Lambda Service**: Lightweight dependencies only (gspread, google-api-client)
- **Fargate Service**: Heavy scientific stack (scanpy, anndata, scipy, numpy)
- **Isolation**: Each service manages its own `pyproject.toml` and virtual environment
- **Build Process**: Services include shared library as path dependency

### **Deployment Structure**

- **Service-Named Directories**: `deployment/{service-name}/` not `deployment/{platform}/`
- **Self-Contained**: Each deployment directory contains all artifacts for that service
- **No Terraform**: Infrastructure managed in separate repository
- **Container-Based**: Both Lambda and Fargate use Docker containers

### **Code Organization**

- **Existing Code Migration**: Current `src/hca_validation/` moves to `shared/src/hca_validation/`
- **Service Code**: New service-specific code in `services/{service}/src/`
- **Import Compatibility**: Shared library maintains existing import paths
- **Test Structure**: Core tests in `shared/tests/`, service tests in `services/{service}/tests/`

### **Build and Development**

- **No Root pyproject.toml**: Each service manages its own dependencies independently (no uv workspace — see #248)
- **Path Dependencies**: Services that use the shared library (`entry-sheet-validator`, `dataset-validator`) declare `hca-validation-shared` in `[project].dependencies`; `[tool.uv.sources] hca-validation-shared = { path = "../../shared", editable = true }` redirects that dependency to the local checkout for development (`cellxgene-validator` and `hca-schema-validator` don't depend on shared)
- **Independent Builds**: Each service can be built and tested independently
- **Shared Development**: Core library changes affect all services
- **CI/CD**: Release automation runs via `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`; there is no automated per-service test CI yet (tracked in #461)

### **Migration Strategy**

- **Phase 1**: Restructure deployment directories (✅ completed for entry-sheet-validator)
- **Phase 2**: Create shared library structure (✅ completed)
- **Phase 3**: Extract service-specific code (✅ completed)
- **Phase 4**: Create h5ad-validator Fargate service (⏳ planned)
- **Phase 5**: Update build processes and documentation (✅ completed)

## Implementation Status

### ✅ **Completed**

**Multi-Service Architecture**
- Shared library created at `shared/` with core validation logic
- Entry sheet validator service extracted to `services/entry-sheet-validator/`
- uv environments configured with project-local `.venv/` directories
- All tests passing including integration tests with Google Sheets API

**Build System**
- Comprehensive Makefile with all build, test, and deployment commands
- LinkML schema validation and Python model generation
- Docker container builds for Lambda deployment
- Data dictionary generation from schemas

**Configuration**
- Environment files (`.env`, `.env.make`) properly configured
- Google Service Account credentials integration
- AWS deployment variables for dev/prod environments
- Pytest markers registered for integration tests

**Documentation**
- README.md updated with new architecture and commands
- DEVELOPMENT.md updated with multi-service workflow
- Architecture documentation reflects current state

### **Key Benefits Achieved**

1. **Service Independence**: Entry sheet validator can be built/deployed independently
2. **Dependency Isolation**: Shared library has minimal dependencies, service adds specific ones
3. **Clean Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and container tests all working
4. **Developer Experience**: Single `make build-all` command sets up everything
5. **Credential Management**: Centralized `.env` files work across all services

### **Next Steps for Future Services**

When adding new services (e.g., H5AD validator):

1. Create `services/new-service/` directory
2. Add `pyproject.toml` with shared library dependency
3. Implement service-specific logic in `services/new-service/src/`
4. Add deployment configuration in `deployment/new-service/`
5. Update Makefile with service-specific targets
